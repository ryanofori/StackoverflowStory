# StackoverflowStory 

StackOverflow using StoryBoard 

## How to use 
Open the Application 
Login to StackOverflow from the webView 
Once login in you will be taken to a question and answer page where you can search for a question or select the question 
You can upVote, DownVote and Favorite a question 
You can create a question 
You can answer a question 
You can see your fav question (even in webView) 

## Things to keep in mind 
Getting a new access token happens every time your old one expires or doesn't exist 
(I think) you can only post a question per day 
You can only answer a question every 30 seconds

(Core features complete will add extra features later)
